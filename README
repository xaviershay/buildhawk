= Buildhawk

Historical information about your build, on a webpage!
Currently only graphs time taken, as stored in git notes.

== Status

Pretty raw: hackish script, no error checking, no test suite. I am adding to it as I use on one of my projects. Only checked on ruby 1.9.2.

== Usage

    # In your project directory, output HTML to stdout
    buildhawk --title "My App Name"

    # Using http://gist.github.com/318247
    buildhawk | browser

You need to store the build time in git notes. The following rake task should work for a standard ruby project with rvm. See http://rhnh.net/2010/09/06/storing-build-time-in-git-notes-with-zsh for more explanation.

    namespace :build do
      desc "Run specs and store the time taken in a git note on HEAD"
      task :time do
        # ruby/rake are not aliased by rvm in the new zsh environment, so
        # have to explicitly call it using the rvm command stored in .rvmrc:
        #   rvm 1.9.2@myapp rake
        #
        # "2> >( )" construct redirects STDERR (where @time@ prints to) to the
        # bracketed commands. ZSH allows us to redirect it twice, once to git,
        # once to cat (back to STDOUT).
        formatter = "tail -n 1 | cut -f 11 -d ' ' - "
        exec((%{zsh -c "(time `cat .rvmrc` rake) } + 
              %{2> >(#{formatter} | git notes --ref=buildtime add -F - -f ) } +
              %{2> >(#{formatter} | cat)"}))
      end
    end
